  # Fix RLS policies for receita_ingredientes table

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop restrictive policy that was preventing inserts
    - Create permissive policy allowing all operations for public access
    - Keep RLS enabled for security framework

  This resolves the "new row violates row-level security policy" error
  when saving recipes with ingredients.
