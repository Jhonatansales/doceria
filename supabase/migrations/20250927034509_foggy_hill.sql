  # Fix RLS policies for receitas table

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive RLS policy that prevents inserts
    - Create permissive policy allowing all operations for public access
    - Keep RLS enabled for security structure

  This allows the application to work during development while maintaining
  the security framework for future authentication implementation.
